# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One way I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure is by running the debugger or using automation to check the code for me rather than doing manual testing.
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret user needs there should be a place for user input and flexibility in the code for it to do whatever the user needs from it.
# How do I approach designing software?
There are many ways to approach designing software but one good way would be to make a mind map of sorts. Or to write down the steps that need to happen in the program and work piece by piece in translating the text into functions and code.
